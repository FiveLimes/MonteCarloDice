"0","#### Creating 100 data points rolling dice a random number of times from 1 to 10000 and comparing the average value to mathematically expected one. In general the more you roll the more accurate your estimate but note diminishing returns. The line is not straight going from 10 to 100 rolls improves the accurecy of the Monte-Carlo estimate much more than going from 1000 to 1090"
